1. ServerBeforeStartingEvent
```
I think this should be called either ServerStartingEvent or ServerAboutToStartEvent
```
ServerAboutToStartEvent Clashes with Forge name
ServerStarting is fine I just wanted to make it clear this is just BEFORE the server starts, I can javadoc it

2. ClientLevelMixin
```
